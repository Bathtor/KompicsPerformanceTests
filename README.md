KompicsPerformanceTests
=======================

A suite of performance tests for Kompics, Kompics Scala and Scala/Akka as comparison.

! Also see http://github.com/senorcarbone/erlang-nnar-kvs which is another implementation of the same algorithms and scenarios in Erlang

----------
The 'Launcher' project contains an Akka-based launcher for the Kompics (Java and Scala) implementations.

---------
The application.conf was used for the original experiments on the SICS cloud testbed and need to be adapted for a new system and every node if the experiment is to be repeated.
